		<li>Google documents tutorial
			
				<ol>
				
						<li>As part of an instructional design course, I created this short lesson on how to use the documents feature of Gmail. The lesson teaches users how to access Google docs, create new Google docs, store Google docs and files, and share Google docs and files with others. </li>

		<li>Trifold Color Brochure
			
				<ol>
		
						<li>As part of a document design course, I created this full-color trifold brochure. The client was a fictional horse rehabilitation and retirement farm in Minnesota. Photos and content were provided by the instructor; design decisions were entirely up to the students.</li>

		<li>Bridges to a New Day newsletter
           	
				<ol>
		
						<li>Toward the end of 2008, I began to volunteer my time as an office worker at Bridges to a New Day, a small but ambitious domestic violence advocacy and counseling agency in Lockport, IL.</li> 
        
						<li>Soon, I was given the unique opportunity to help this agency develop its media presence and increase PR efforts. One of my projects was the design and development of a seasonal newsletter. My purpose with this project was to create something that was more visually appealing than its predecessor but that still retained a look familiar to long-time supporters. All feedback so far has been very positive.</li>
        
						<li>A full, PDF version of the newsletter can be viewed by following the link below.</li>
