	<h3>How To Date On A Budget</h3>
	<h4>by Brenna Scurlock</h4>
    <h4>Published in the Bradley Scout</h4>

	<p>Dinner and a movie: couples have been going on this classic date since motion pictures first premiered. This traditional outing covers all the dating bases – food, entertainment and time spent together.</p>
<p>But with rising restaurant and theater costs, young couples need to be more creative with their courtship so as not to break the bank with every rendezvous.</p>
<p>A cheap date doesn’t have to be a meaningless date. With these inexpensive date ideas, you can skimp on money spent and still spend valuable time with your significant other.</p>
<p><b>Have an adventure in cooking</b></p>
<p>If you have access to a kitchen, pick up some basic ingredients and cook a meal together. Spaghetti is one of the few meals that is classy, cheap and easy. You don’t have to be a culinary artist to boil noodles and heat up sauce. You can also butter some toast and season it with garlic salt to make garlic bread.</p>
<p>If you don’t have your own kitchen, you can barbeque on a public grill in St. James or Laura Bradley Park. Pick up some basic supplies at the dollar store. You can barbeque just about any meat or vegetable – there are options to please every palate. </p>
<p>Cooking together allows you and your date to help each other learn something new. Restaurants, while romantic, limit your interaction to conversation – and they’ll charge you for it.</p>
<p><b>Browse for hours</b></p>
<p>A bookstore like Barnes and Noble can actually be a dating paradise. There are enough books, magazines and CDs to keep you occupied for hours, and plenty of coffee and desserts to fuel conversation.</p>
<p>Lengthy browsing is not only perfectly natural at Barnes and Noble, it is encouraged by the overstuffed chairs and reading tables scattered throughout the store.</p>
<p>Each section of the store offers a unique opportunity to learn more about your date.
You can discuss travel dreams while leafing through guidebooks, music preferences while sampling tracks in the music section or artistic tastes while exploring the coffee table books.</p>
<p>This date can be completely free if you’re able to resist the urge to splurge on Starbucks. And if you’ve paid close enough attention to what your date picked up to read, you now have future gift ideas.</p>
<p>You don’t have to limit your date to the bookstore – museums, art galleries, flea markets and festivals all offer free or discounted browsing opportunities.  Peoria is home to both the Lakeview Museum of Arts and Sciences and the Contemporary Art Center, and the riverfront hosts a variety of open markets and cultural and musical festivals during the summer and fall seasons. </p>
<p><b>Explore the great outdoors</b></p>
<p>When weather permits, the Bradley neighborhood is a great place for an outdoor date.
Laura Bradley Park is home to a public disc golf course. Borrow some discs from a friend or pick up your own at Co-Op in Campus Town. The course takes you over hills and through ravines and the park is usually so peaceful that it’s easy to forget you’re minutes from the city. </p>
<p>Take advantage of one of the park’s fields and fly a kite. Make your own paper kite or find an inexpensive one at the dollar store or Wal Mart. 
The park also has volleyball nets, tennis courts and plenty of secluded benches and groves for a private picnic.</p>
<p>If Laura Bradley Park isn’t far enough from home, there are an abundance of forest preserves in central Illinois that you can visit and explore for little to no cost. 
Peoria Heights is home to a forest preserve and a number of parks and scenic clearings overlooking the Illinois River. 
Wildlife Prairie State Park and Jubilee College State Park are both located within 30 miles of Peoria and offer hiking, nature watching and other outdoor activities.</p>
<p>With the exception of Wildlife Prairie Park, where admission is $5, all of these parks are free, open to the public and good for an afternoon’s worth of fun.</p>
<p><b>Stay in for a night</b></p>
<p>If a public outing doesn’t sound appealing or if the weather’s got you down, spending an evening at home can be the perfect convenient date.</p>
<p>Rent a video for less than you’d pay at the theater, scrounge up a bag of popcorn and two cans of soda and you’ve made yourself a night at the movies. If you’re really pressed for cash, you can rent movies for free at the library.
If you’d rather talk than sit in the dark, find an old board game to play. Checkers, Scrabble, Mancala or a simple card game are all easy-to-learn options.</p>
<p>Just make sure you clean up beforehand, play music instead of the television, and have snacks on hand to make the date complete.</p>
<p>Whether you want to spend an afternoon, an evening or a meal together, there are limitless options to create an inexpensive date. When you cook, browse, play or simply spend time with your significant other without extravagant fees or costs, you have an experience where the focus is on each other, not how much money you’ve spent. Dating on a budget is possible, and you may get more out of it than a few extra bills in your wallet.</p>
