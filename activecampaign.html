	<h2>Why do I want to work in technical support with ActiveCampaign?</h2>
	
		<p>A career in technical support would combine one of my strongest skills - problem-solving - with one of my biggest interests - web-based technology. I'm a natural at customer service, a skill I discovered during my time as a member services rep for the YMCA. I've been developing my proficiency with web technology for the past two years at Illinois Tech, including working with PHP and MySQL.</p>
		
		<p>More importantly, I believe in the service ActiveCampaign provides. Email and other online media are the future of marketing, and small businesses should be able to access and afford this technology. I would be proud to work for a company that enables such businesses to reach and retain their customers. (Plus, you had me at "Kitchen full of coffee, tea, soda, candy, snacks, etc...")</p>
        
	<h2>What experience do I have?</h2>

		<p>I have worked with PHP/MySQL in developing sites with the Drupal content-management system, as well as some beginner development with Ruby on Rails. I'm most familiar with basic FTP clients like FileZilla, which I use to update my own website, but I'm also comfortable using the command line to push and pull files. As part of my masters project, I developed a Drupal site that I update through SSH with help from Git. I also use GitHub, accessed through an SSH public key, to manage most of my web design projects.</p>
		
		<p>What I don't know I learn quickly and easily - I love the web and web development, and I jump at any opportunity to learn more.</p>
    	
	<h2>Writing sample #1:</h2>
	
		<p><b>Explain to a client the differences/advantages between the email marketing service (SAAS) and our email marketing downloaded software (PHP/MYSQL product they install on their own server).</b></p>
		
		<p>We offer two types of email marketing: hosted service and downloaded software. It is important to note that both include the full set of ActiveCampaign features - the main difference is where the software "ives."</p>
		
		<p>The hosted service "lives" on our server. This is what we recommend to most clients - you don't have to worry about installing and maintaining any software, we take care of all upgrades, and addons are free. We even ensure the delivery of your email and keep all your information backed up. Hosted service is the worry-free approach to email marketing - we do the work so you can focus on your ad campaign. Pricing for this option is based on your number of email subscribers, and there is no limit to the number of emails you send.</p>
		
		<p>The downloaded software "lives" on your server. This is a more advanced option, since you will need a server to host the software yourself and any upgrades, addons, or backups are completely up to you. There is no subscriber limit when you host the software yourself, so this might be a good option if you anticipate over 50,000 subscribers. Pricing for this option is based on the number of licenses you purchase.</p>
		
		<p>I would recommend the hosted service, especially if this is your first experience with an email marketing service. You can get started immediately, and we have extensive online support to help you make the most of your subscription.</p>
		
	<h2>Writing sample #2:</h2>
	
		<p><b>Reply to a frustrated client that is asking why their email was filtered to the spam folder and what they can do to prevent that.</b></p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, as email clients improve their spam filters, your email is increasingly likely to get caught in the net. There are a few ways you can lessen this likelihood:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Request that your subscribers add your list email address to their contacts list. Obviously this creates an extra step for your clients, but it will ensure that your email reaches them each time.</li>
			
			<li>Run your email through a spam filter, which will check for trigger words and phrases. Clients of ActiveCampaign's Email Marketing have access to an EmailCheck addon that will highlight problem areas for you.</li>
			
			<li>Add a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record to your domain name. This is a more advanced step, but it may reduce the chance that your email will be marked as spam. See <a href="http://www.activecampaign.com/blog/setting-up-and-verifying-spf-records/">this article</a> from our blog to learn more about SPF and find out how you can add a record to your domain.</li>
			
		</ol>
		
		<p>While none of these methods are completely guaranteed, you should see some improvement. The best way to avoid the spam folder is to maintain a positive relationship with your email clients. Please let me know if I can help you access EmailCheck or add an SPF record to your domain.</p>
