			<h5>Alphabet Soup</h5>
			
			<p>A game for foodies. Players must eat at one restaurant in Chicago for each letter of the alphabet. This site is both a class assignment and a personal project. You can follow development <a href="http://bingo.eva-wilhelm.com/">here</a>. Design team: Ann Goliak, Brenna Scurlock, Eva Wilhelm.</p>
			
			<h5>Write IIT</h5>
			
			<p>As my master's project, I have elected to create a Drupal site for the IIT Humanities Department in collaboration with the Writing Center. My goal is to have writing resources for each of the freshman-level humanities courses available online. You can follow development <a href="http://write-iit.brennascurlock.com">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Age of Darwin Drupal Site</h3>
			<h4>Created Fall 2010</h4>
			
			<p>For an exercise exploring the Drupal content-management system (CMS), I created this site for a philosophy course.</p>
			
			<p>We used Drupal 7, which was still in beta at the time. This presented a number of challenges, as the documentation for this development release was still, well, under development.</p>
			
			<p>Since this site was made, Drupal 7 has been officially released, along with a number of modules that might have made this site better. However, I have left it in its original state to preserve what I was able to accomplish at the time.</p>

			<h3>Butterfat Tattoo Drupal Site</h3>
			<h4>Created Fall 2010</h4>
			
			<p>In another exercise exploring the Drupal CMS, I worked with a team to create this site for an actual client, a tattoo artist based in Chicago.</p>
			
			<p>We worked in direct collaboration with our client, building the site to her minimalist specifications. This presented something of a challenge, as we were prepared to pull out all the stops and add as much functionality to the site as Drupal would allow. This website was an exercise in constraint.</p>

			<h3>Google Documents Tutorial</h3>
			<h4>Created Spring 2010</h4>

			<p>As part of an instructional design course, I created this short lesson on how to use the documents feature of Gmail.</p> 
	
			<p>The lesson teaches users how to access Google docs, create new Google docs, store Google docs and files, and share Google docs and files with others.</p>
	
			<p>The lesson ends with a small task to measure what students have learned.</p>

			<h3>Research Paper Toolbox</h3>
			<h4>Created Spring 2010</h4>
			
			<p>This project was another exploration in instructional design. I worked with a team to create several lessons that make up this "toolbox" for writing a graduate-level research paper.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to weaving together the lessons, I worked with another team member to style the entire site.</p>
			
			<p>Design team: Marshall Browning, Nicole Petrone, Andrew Roback, Taryn Sauer, Brenna Scurlock and Eva Wilhelm.</p>

			<h3>Trifold Color Brochure</h3>
			<h4>Created Spring 2010</h4>

			<p>As part of a document design course, I created this full-color trifold brochure.</p> 
	
			<p>The client was a fictional horse rehabilitation and retirement farm in Minnesota. Photos and content were provided by the instructor; design decisions were entirely up to the students.</p>
	
			<p>I consider this one of my most professional-looking pieces. I was inspired by the red on the barn, and added the golden yellow for a very farm-like contrast.</p>

			<h3>Web-ready Flyer for 2010 Museums Making Connections Conference</h3>
			<h4>Created Spring 2010</h4>


			<p>This web flyer was created through a document design course for a real client: the Association of Midwest Museums. The AMM was having its 2010 annual conference in Cleveland, and our class was invited to sumbit design ideas to be used as promotional materials for the conference.</p>

			<p>While this design was not selected for the conference, it was applauded for its whimsical approach. The image features a dinosaur from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History approaching the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

			<p>Design team: Christopher Chock, Serena Li, Brenna Scurlock and Emily Sutherlin.</p>

			<h3>Bridges to a New Day Spring Newsletter</h3>
			<h4>Created Spring 2009</h4>


			<p>Toward the end of 2008, I began to volunteer my time as an office worker at Bridges to a New Day, a small but ambitious domestic violence advocacy and counseling agency in Lockport, IL.</p> 
        
			<p>Soon, I was given the unique opportunity to help this agency develop its media presence and increase PR efforts. One of my projects was the design and development of a seasonal newsletter. My purpose with this project was to create something that was more visually appealing than its predecessor but that still retained a look familiar to long-time supporters. All feedback so far has been very positive.</p>
        
			<p>A full, PDF version of the newsletter can be viewed by following the link below.</p>

				<li>Roots Grow Deep at Corn Stock Theatre

					<ol>

						<li>From <i>art and society</i></li>

						<li>Nestled in the lush foliage of upper Bradley Park, Corn Stock Theatre offers local thespians and theater patrons alike a creative outlet, a source of entertainment and a strong sense of community. Peoria's only outdoor theater provides a tranquil viewing ambiance that makes it the "prettiest place to see theater in the area," according to business manager Cindy Hoey. With a league of dedicated volunteers and a venue unlike any other, Corn Stock Theatre serves as a truly unique example of local, independent theater.</li>

				<li>How to Date on a Budget

					<ol>

						<li>From the Bradley Scout</li>

						<li>Dinner and a movie: couples have been going on this classic date since motion pictures first premiered. This traditional outing covers all the dating bases: food, entertainment and time spent together. But with rising restaurant and theater costs, young couples need to be more creative with their courtship so as not to break the bank with every rendezvous.</li>

				<li>Pouch takes the Ouch out of Recovery

					<ol>

						<li>From <i>The Peoria Woman</i></li>

						<li>With a little fabric, some thread, a lot of creativity and even more generosity, sewers across the country will band together in 2008 in a national effort to produce thousands of pain-relieving pouches that originated right here in Peoria.</li>
