    <h1>Why on Earth would anybody want to hire me?</h1>
    
    <p>Here are a few reasons (five, to be exact).</p>
        
        <ol>
            
            <li>I can write. I studied journalism as an undergrad and wrote for several publications. I can whip up a memo, press release, announcement or blog post in no time. Not only do I have the education of a writer - I also read, a lot. I can tell what works and what doesn't.</li>

            <li>I have a great eye for detail. Whether I'm scanning a document for spelling mistakes or making minor adjustments to a page layout, I show no mercy for even the slightest errors.</li> 

            <li>I communicate well. Sure, a lot of people say this - but I actually consider it one of my strongest skills. I've worked cooperatively with team members, clients, outside contributors and all levels of management; I thrive in each situation.</li>

            <li>I love to get involved. I will always have a life outside of work, but I think company outings, clubs or volunteer projects are a great way to make your work life more rewarding. Sign me up!</li>

            <li>Above all, I'm creative. I relish in the opportunity to make something new, improved, fresh. Whether I'm designing something on the fly or trying to improve a process, I consider it a challenge to come up with a solution that others may not have thought of.</li> 
        
        </ol>
