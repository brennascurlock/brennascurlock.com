	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
		<p>You can learn about my work experience by reading my resume and browsing my portfolio. However fascinating my professional and educational exploits may be, they only present one side of my story.</p>
        
		<p>I've always felt that the places we live help define who we are. I spent my early years (like pre-school early) growing up in suburban Denver, CO and rural Iowa (in a farmhouse - there were horses!). I credit those years for instilling in me an intense appreciation for natural landscapes. Around '91, my family settled in what was then the small farm community of Plainfield, IL (claim to fame: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Plainfield_tornado">the F5 twister of 1990!</a>)</p>
		
		<p>Plainfield is my home town. It will always be the place where I learned to drive in my dad's cherry red Ford pickup, to swim competitively in the frigid waters of the public pool, and to flatten coins on the railroad track that ran through our backyard. It's a different town now, but my memories will never lose that fond feeling.</p>
        
		<p>Since enrolling at IIT, I've become a bona fide citizen of Chicago, the residential goal of many who spent their childhood in the 'burbs. I'm new here, so I'm still learning the ropes - but never before has being "new in town" been so much fun! I'm in my last semester at IIT, and I look forward to spending the next few years happily working amid the productive buzz of the big city. (That's my subtle way of saying <a href="hire-me.html">"I'm for hire!"</a>)</p>
        
	<h2>About this site</h2>

		<p>This version of my website was written in XHTML 1.0 Strict, as a requirement for one of my favorite courses, Standards-Based Web Design. I am currently learning the ropes of HTML5 and cannot <em>wait</em> to rewrite my site in this exciting new format. As soon as I find time to do so, I will post links showing my progress.</p>
